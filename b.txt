Have you ever stood and stared at it, marveled at it's beauty, it's genius?
Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious.
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world.
Where none suffered.
Where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster.
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering.
The perfect world would dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization.
I say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization which is of course what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus, evolution, like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.
